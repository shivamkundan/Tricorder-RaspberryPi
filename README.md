# Tricorder-RaspberryPi
The most advanced Tricorder device from Star Trek yet implemented. If you ever ask
yourself “is the sky more red at sunset?”, “how clean is my air?”, “how bright is my TV?”, “what flower is this?”, “how hot is this object?”, “how busy are the airwaves?”, and seek the answer in real-time, beautifully visualized 18-bit color, then this is the device for you.
